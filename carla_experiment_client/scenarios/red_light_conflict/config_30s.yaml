scenario:
  # Critical event at ~40s
  # NEW DESIGN: Ego approaches on GREEN, then light turns RED creating conflict
  # Phase 1 (0-35s): Light is GREEN, ego approaches intersection
  # Phase 2 (35s+): Light turns RED, MULTIPLE cross vehicles released
  spawn_offset_m: 400.0              # Distance for ~35s approach at moderate speed
  red_light_frame: 700               # Light turns RED at 35s (20fps)
  cross_release_frame: 740           # Cross vehicles released 2s after red light
  ego_speed_delta: -10.0             # Ego slightly faster than limit
  ego_follow_distance_m: 15.0        # Comfortable following distance
  ego_ignore_lights_percentage: 0.0  # Respect lights (will stop at red)
  ego_ignore_vehicles_percentage: 0.0
  # MULTIPLE cross traffic vehicles for realistic conflict
  cross_vehicle_count: 4             # 4 cross vehicles at intersection
  cross_vehicle_spacing_m: 6.0       # Spacing between cross vehicles
  # MORE traffic for realistic city scene
  background_vehicle_count: 20       # More background vehicles
  background_walker_count: 5         # Some pedestrians
  background_min_distance_m: 40.0    # Allow closer vehicles
  prewarm_seconds: 1.0
  # Nearby vehicles for traffic density (waiting at ego's side of intersection)
