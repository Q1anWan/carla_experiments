scenario:
  # Critical event at ~40s
  # Emergency vehicle approaches rapidly from behind, ego must yield
  # Timing: emergency starts 25m behind for faster catch-up
  emergency_spawn_distance_m: 25.0   # Start 25m behind ego (closer for detection)
  emergency_speed_delta: -50.0       # 50% faster than limit (more aggressive)
