# Natural Driving Behavior Configuration
#
# These parameters control how human-like the autonomous driving behavior appears.
# Based on human factors research and ISO 2631-1 comfort guidelines.

# Driving style presets
# Choose from: relaxed, normal, assertive
default_preset: normal

# Custom configuration (overrides preset if specified)
custom:
  # Speed behavior
  speed_delta_percent: 10.0  # Percentage slower than speed limit (human-like: 5-15%)
  speed_variance_percent: 5.0  # Natural speed variation

  # Following behavior (human time headway: 1.5-2.5s)
  desired_headway_s: 1.8  # Target time headway in seconds
  min_follow_distance_m: 5.0  # Minimum following distance in meters

  # Comfort thresholds (ISO 2631-1 guidelines)
  max_comfort_accel_mps2: 2.0  # Max comfortable acceleration (m/s²)
  max_comfort_decel_mps2: 3.0  # Max comfortable deceleration (m/s²)
  max_comfort_jerk_mps3: 1.5  # Max comfortable jerk (m/s³)

  # Lane change behavior
  lane_change_distance_m: 30.0  # Minimum distance for safe lane change
  auto_lane_change: true  # Allow automatic lane changes

  # Traffic light behavior
  ignore_lights_percent: 0.0  # Compliance with traffic lights (0 = full compliance)
  yellow_light_reaction: cautious  # Options: cautious, aggressive

  # Intersection behavior
  ignore_vehicles_percent: 0.0  # Safety margin at intersections

  # Smoothing parameters (0-1, higher = more responsive, lower = smoother)
  throttle_smoothing: 0.3
  brake_smoothing: 0.4
  steering_smoothing: 0.2

# Scenario-specific overrides
scenarios:
  highway_merge:
    speed_delta_percent: 5.0  # Faster on highway
    desired_headway_s: 1.5
    lane_change_distance_m: 25.0

  lane_change_cut_in:
    desired_headway_s: 2.0
    max_comfort_decel_mps2: 3.5  # Allow slightly harder braking for cut-in

  pedestrian_emerge:
    max_comfort_decel_mps2: 4.0  # Emergency braking allowed
    desired_headway_s: 2.5

  yield_to_emergency:
    speed_delta_percent: 20.0  # Slow down more
    desired_headway_s: 3.0

  unprotected_left_turn:
    speed_delta_percent: 15.0
    desired_headway_s: 2.2

  red_light_conflict:
